## Summary

A custom Home Assistant integration for monitoring devices managed with Teltonika RMS, with an optional reboot action from Home Assistant.

The integration connects to the RMS API, discovers your devices, and creates Home Assistant entities for connectivity, diagnostics, timestamps, and optional location tracking.

## What This Component Provides

- Per-device entities:
  - `binary_sensor`: online connectivity
  - `sensor`: model, firmware, serial, last seen timestamp
  - additional `sensor` entities when RMS provides the data:
    - clients count
    - router uptime
    - temperature
    - signal strength
    - WAN state
    - connection state
    - connection type
    - SIM slot
  - `button`: per-device reboot action
  - `device_tracker` (optional): GPS location only for devices that provide coordinates, including detailed location attributes (`location_detail`, `coordinates`, `google_maps_url`)
- Service:
  - `teltonika_rms.refresh` to trigger immediate refresh
- Authentication with either:
  - OAuth2 (authorization code + PKCE)
  - Personal Access Token (PAT)
- Device polling with request-budget safeguards (RMS monthly quota aware)
- API envelope parsing (`success`, `data`, `errors`, `meta`)
- Status-channel handling (`meta.channel`) with Socket.IO first, HTTP polling fallback

## Installation

### Option 1: Install with HACS

1. Open HACS in Home Assistant.
2. Go to Integrations.
3. Add this repository as a Custom Repository (type: `Integration`).
4. Search for `Teltonika RMS`.
5. Install and restart Home Assistant.

### Option 2: Manual Installation

1. Copy this folder to your Home Assistant config:
   - `/config/custom_components/teltonika_rms`
2. Ensure files like `manifest.json` and `__init__.py` are directly inside that folder.
3. Restart Home Assistant.

## Credentials Setup

### OAuth2 (recommended)

1. Ensure [my.home-assistant.io](https://my.home-assistant.io/) is linked to your current Home Assistant instance.
   - Open [my.home-assistant.io](https://my.home-assistant.io/).
   - Confirm it resolves to the Home Assistant instance where you want to add this integration.
   - If it does not open the correct instance, fix that first before creating the RMS OAuth application.
2. Log in to RMS.
   - Open [RMS](https://rms.teltonika-networks.com/).
   - Sign in with the RMS account that owns the devices you want to monitor.
   - Complete two-factor authentication if your account requires it.
3. Create an OAuth application in [RMS Account Settings](https://account.rms.teltonika-networks.com/settings/application).
4. Configure redirect URL:
   - `https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/oauth`
5. Set the application type to `Confidential`.
5. Grant at least this scope to the application:
   - `devices:read`
6. Add these scopes if needed:
   - `device_location:read` for GPS tracker entities
   - `device_actions:read` for broader status/channel visibility
   - `device_actions:write` for the reboot button
7. In Home Assistant, go to:
   - `Settings -> Devices & Services` then click on the three dots in the upper right corner and select `Application Credentials`
8. Add `Teltonika RMS` credentials (client ID + client secret).
9. Go to `Settings -> Devices & Services -> Add Integration`.
10. Select `Teltonika RMS`.
11. When the integration asks for the authentication mode, select `OAuth2 (recommended)`.
12. Confirm the dialog that opens to link the Teltonika OAuth application with Home Assistant.
13. Confirm the dialog that opens to link the Teltonika account to Home Assistant.
14. After successful authorization, Home Assistant imports the RMS devices and lets you assign them to areas.

### Personal Access Token (PAT)

1. Log in to RMS.
   - Open [RMS](https://rms.teltonika-networks.com/).
   - Sign in with the RMS account that owns the devices you want to monitor.
   - Open [Account Settings](https://account.rms.teltonika-networks.com/settings/profile).
   - Complete [two-factor authentication](https://account.rms.teltonika-networks.com/settings/security) (required for PAT generation).
2. In RMS, generate a [Personal Access Token](https://account.rms.teltonika-networks.com/settings/tokens):
   1. Create a new token and copy it immediately.
   2. Grant at least:
      - `devices:read`
   3. Add these if needed:
      - `device_location:read` for GPS tracker entities
      - `device_actions:read` for broader status/channel visibility
      - `device_actions:write` for the reboot button

## Configuration in Home Assistant

1. Go to `Settings -> Devices & Services -> Add Integration`.
2. Select `Teltonika RMS`.
3. Choose auth mode:
   - `OAuth2 (recommended)` or `Personal access token (PAT)`.
4. Finish authentication.
5. If you want to use the reboot button with OAuth2 and you authenticated before version `0.6.0`, reauthenticate once so Home Assistant can request `device_actions:write`.
6. Open integration options to tune:
   - Inventory polling interval
   - State polling interval
   - Device count estimate
   - Optional tag/status filters
   - Enable/disable location tracker entities
   - Optional `spec_path` (compiled OpenAPI YAML on HA filesystem)

## Endpoint Matrix

- Runtime endpoint matrix is loaded from `spec_path` when configured.
- If unavailable or invalid, bundled `endpoint_matrix_frozen.json` is used.
- Regenerate bundled matrix from OpenAPI YAML:

```bash
python3 tools/generate_rms_endpoint_matrix.py /path/to/compiled.yaml
```

## Conventions and Tests

- Development conventions are aligned with Home Assistant custom integration guidance:
  - [Home Assistant Developer Docs](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/development_index/)
- Translation consistency can be validated with:

```bash
python3 tools/check_translations.py
```

- Test suite follows HA-style layout under:
  - `tests/unit/` (runs without Home Assistant dependencies)
  - `tests/ha/` (requires Home Assistant Python dependencies)

- Run tests with:

```bash
python3 -m pytest
```

Note: HA-related tests under `tests/ha/` will only run in a suitable Home Assistant development environment (see [Developer Docs](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/development_index/)).

- Release notes are tracked in:
  - `CHANGELOG.md`

## Git Hooks and Version Tags

Install repository hooks once:

```bash
tools/install_git_hooks.sh
```

`pre-commit` hook behavior:

- Runs always with `--maxfail=0`:
  - without `homeassistant`: `tests/unit`
  - with `homeassistant`: `tests/unit` + `tests/ha`
- Always prints per-test summary with:
  - test name
  - duration
  - result
- Blocks commit when at least one test fails

`pre-push` hook behavior:

- Ensures a version tag `v<manifest.version>` exists before push
- Ensures the tag is part of current branch history

Publish the current version as a GitHub release:

```bash
tools/publish_release.sh
```

This will:

- create the local version tag if it does not exist yet
- push the current branch and tags to GitHub
- create or update the matching entry on the GitHub Releases page
